> Hello again


There is not much results to show. I have successfully pushed the text from my Rstudio to Github. The beginning was little messy, but with the help of helpdesk and my colleague, everything works now. I know how to write _cursive_, **bold** and even add a [link](https://tajataja.github.io/IODS-project/). Pretty impressive, huh?

In addition I completed the two first sets on DataCamp. Such fun stuff!
